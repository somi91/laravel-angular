First, add this on your page once

<script src="//fortumo.com/javascripts/fortumopay.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

And then add this where you want the payment button

<a id="fmp-button" href="#" rel="e18adcbdace6855b796ef87356996244"><img src="//fortumo.com/images/fmp/fortumopay_96x47.png" width="96" height="47" alt="Mobile Payments by Fortumo" border="0" /></a>

You can connect payment with particular resource (i.e user) of your system by putting its ID (separated by "/") to the end of serviceID inside the button "rel" attribute. This ID will be will be included in the reply requests to your server with parameter cuid.
